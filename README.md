**What Went Well**
The main gameplay of RuneBreaker works great. The ball, paddle, and bricks interact smoothly, and power-ups add fun variety. Levels gradually get harder, keeping the game interesting, and the score and lives system work as expected. The glowing bricks and particle effects give the game a really nice and polished feel.

**What Wasn’t So Well**
Making bitmaps for bricks, runes, and menus took a lot of time. Designing levels was tricky, and sometimes the gameplay felt off. The ball sometimes behaves oddly on the edges of the paddle, and saving/loading high scores could be improved for more reliable game progress and to show off to more people.

**Future Improvements**
The game could benefit from better level design with more varied challenges and more rune designs to make gameplay more interesting. Adding sound effects and background music would improve the overall experience.


**Dependencies Used**

C++
SDL3
Standard Library - iostream, Vector, String

AI Usage I used AI (ChatGPT) to help make the rune system and menu animations. This includes rune shapes, the font mapping, and the drop shadow text. I checked and edited all the code myself.
